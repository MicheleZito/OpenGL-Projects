# C++ OpenGL Project : Wordle

## The Project
Inspired by the online namesake game by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) here is a C++ and OpenGL implementation. Having an unseen target 5-letter english word,
with only 6 trials, try to guess it. The letters used in the trials give hints on whether the letters are included or not in the target. Following are screenshots of the game scene.
The user can use his/her keyboard to insert letters, or use the keyboard buttons on screen.

Note: the words.txt file that is being used in the code is comprehensive of five thousands and 7 hundreds (more or less) 5-letter english words, is not included here. But it can be easily found online.
